To compile: `make {udp,tcp}`
To run:
		`./RPNsrv-{udp,tcp} 13831`
		`./RPNcl-{udp,tcp} 127.0.0.1 13831 '25 5 * 60 +'`

Implementation:
		Client handles stack while server does the actual math.
		For TCP, the connection stays open until the client sends the server '-1' at which point the connection is closed

Sample Data:
		200 200 +
		400

		25 5 * 60 +
		185

		200 200 500 + -
		-500

		20 100 100 + /
		10

		100 20 2 / /
		10
